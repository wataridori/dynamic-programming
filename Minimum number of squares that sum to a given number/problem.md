# Problem
Given a positive integer `n`, find the minimum number of squares that sums to `n`.

Note that 1 is a square and we can **always** break a number as `1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + â€¦`. So a number can **always** be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers.

Example: 
- With `n = 100`, the minumum number of squares is `1`, because `100 = 10^2`
- With `n = 10`, the minumum number of squares is `2`, because `10 = 3^2 + 1^2`

## Input
Number `n`
```
100
```

## Output
The minimum number of squares that sum to `n`
```
1
```
