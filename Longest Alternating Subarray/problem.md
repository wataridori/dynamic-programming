# Problem
Given an array which includes positive and negative numbers only. 

An Alternating Subarray is a subarray with alternating positive and negative elements. Find the Alternating Subarray which is as long as possible.

For example: Given the array `[3, -5, 4, 1, -2, 3, -7, -1]`, the Longest Alternating Subarray of it is `[1, -2, 3, -7]`, and its lenght is `4`

## Input
The array
```
3 -5 4 1 -2 3 -7 -1
```

## Output 
The length of the Longest Alternating Subarray
```
4
```
