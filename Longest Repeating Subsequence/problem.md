# Problem
The Longest Repeating Subsequence problem is finding the longest subsequences of a string such that the two subsequences don't have same string character at same position.
Print out the length of the Longest Repeating Subsequence

## Sample
```
// Input
str = "wataridori"
// Output
3
// longest_repeating_subsequence = "ari"
```

```
// Input
str = "ABCBBDECABED"
// Output
4
// longest_repeating_subsequence = "BCBD" or "BCBE"
```
