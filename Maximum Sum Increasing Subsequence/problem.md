# Problem
Given an array of `n` positive integers. Find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The maximum sum increasing subsequence is not necessarily contiguous or unique.

## Sample
### Input
```
a = [5, 7, 10, 3, 7, 9, 12, 8, 10, 11, 14]
```
### Output
```
56
// Maximum sum increasing subsequence is [5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14]
```
