# Problem
Given the set `S` of positive integers, determine if it can be partitioned into three disjoint subsets that all have the same sum, and they **cover** `S`

For example:
```
S = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 7, 8]
```
can be divided into `S1 = [3, 7]`, `S2 = [4, 5, 1]` and `S3 = [2, 8]`, which all have the sum is 10.

So the answer is `YES`, `S = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 7, 8]` can be partitioned into three disjoint subsets that all have the same sum.

## Sample
### Input
```
S = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 7, 8]
```

### Output
```
YES
